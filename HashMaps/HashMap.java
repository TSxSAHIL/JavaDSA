/*
    HashMaps Data Structure
    We use hashmaps becuase of constant time complexity.
    1. We need all elements ad positive numbers -> Hashcode function
    2. Hashcode can be very large so reduce it, it is called hashing
    
    ** Two ways to avoid collions
    1. Chaining 
    2. Open Addressing
