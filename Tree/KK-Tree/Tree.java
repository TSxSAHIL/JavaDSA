/*
   BINARY TREE
//  * Size of tree = Total num. of nodes
//  * Child of Tree - The node below it
//  * Parent - The Node above it
    * Edge - The line connecting two nodes
    * Height - Max number of edges

    Types of Binary Tree
    1. Complete Binary Tree -> All levels are full but last level is empty from left tp roght
    2. Full Binary Tree / Strict Binary Tree -> Each node has either 0 or 2 children (No one Child)
    3. Perfect Binary Tree -> All the internal nodes have two children and all the leaf nodes are on same level and all the level are full
    4. Height Balanceed Binary tree -> Average Height O(log n)
    5. Skewed Binary Tree -> Every node has only one child (Average height - > O(n) just like linked list)
    6. Ordered Binary Tree -> Every node has some property. Example Binary Search Tree
