    -> Encapsulation means wrapping up the implementation of the data members & methods inside a class.
    -> Abstraction means hiding the unnecssary details and showing valueable information.

    -> Example 
    -> Starting of a car (how the engine mechanism is working we dont care it is abstraction)
    -> Abstraction -> design level issue (Process of gaining info)
    -> Encapsulation -> implementation level issue (Process of containing info)
